Exercise 3: Dynamic Survey Builder with DOM-Generated Forms
Scenario:
You need to create a survey builder that generates dynamic forms based on predefined questions and validates them before submission.
Requirements:
1.	Create a structure to store questions and their types (text, radio, checkbox).
2.	Dynamically generate form fields based on question type using JavaScript.
3.	Implement client-side validation for mandatory questions, character limits, and selection counts.
4.	Use JavaScript functions to validate inputs before form submission.
5.	Manipulate the DOM to show inline validation messages for invalid responses.
6.	Prevent form submission until all fields pass validation.
