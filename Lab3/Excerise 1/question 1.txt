Exercise 1: Adaptive Registration System with Dynamic Validation Rules
Scenario:
You are building a user registration system where the validation rules change dynamically based on the user's selected role (Student, Teacher, or Admin). The system should adjust the validation accordingly.
Requirements:
1.	Create a registration form with name, email, password, confirm password, age, role, and skills.
2.	Implement dynamic validation rules based on the selected role (e.g., stronger password requirements for admins).
3.	Use JavaScript to check email domain validity and validate password strength.
4.	Use functions to manage validation feedback dynamically.
5.	Manipulate the DOM to show/hide form fields and highlight invalid inputs in real-time.
6.	Prevent form submission until all validation rules are satisfied.
