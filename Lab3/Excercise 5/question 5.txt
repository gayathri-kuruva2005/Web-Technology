Exercise 5: Multi-Stage Client-Side Form Workflow Engine
Scenario:
Design a multi-step form with strict validation at each stage, where users must complete each stage before moving on.
Requirements:
1.	Divide the form into four stages with different validation rules for each.
2.	Use JavaScript to control navigation, ensuring users can only proceed if all fields are valid.
3.	Display progress dynamically using a progress bar.
4.	Use DOM manipulation to show/hide stages based on user navigation.
5.	Prevent navigation and form submission if any stage fails validation.
6.	Store user input temporarily in JavaScript variables.
