Exercise 4: Real-Time User Activity Monitor
Scenario:
Develop a system to monitor and log user activities (clicks, key presses, focus changes) in real time.
Requirements:
1.	Track clicks, key presses, and focus events using event listeners.
2.	Store each activity in an array of objects.
3.	Use event bubbling and capturing to track both direct and propagated events.
4.	Dynamically display the activity log using the DOM.
5.	Set thresholds for suspicious activity (e.g., too many clicks) and trigger warnings.
6.	Provide a button to reset and export the activity log as formatted text.
