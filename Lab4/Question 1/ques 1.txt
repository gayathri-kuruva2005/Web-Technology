Exercise 1: Real-Time Username Availability Checker
Scenario:
You are building a registration system where the username must be verified instantly without refreshing the page.
Requirements:
•	Create a registration form with a username input field.
•	Use AJAX (XMLHttpRequest or Fetch API) to send the username to a backend service.
•	Simulate server-side validation using:
o	A local JSON file
•	Process the response:
o	If username exists → show "Username already taken".
o	If available → show "Username available".
•	Display validation feedback dynamically using DOM manipulation.
•	Prevent form submission if username is unavailable.
•	Show loading indicator while request is in progress.
