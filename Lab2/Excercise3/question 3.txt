Exercise 3: Advanced Drag and Drop Task Manager

Create a mini task board using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The page must contain:
• A text box to enter task name
• An Add Task button
• Three task columns:
•	To Do
•	In Progress
•	Completed
When the Add Task button is clicked:
• A new draggable task card must be created dynamically
• The task card must display the task name and current date
Using Drag & Drop:
• Tasks must be draggable between the three columns
• When a task is dropped into Completed:
•	Change its background color
•	Display a message “Task Completed Successfully”
